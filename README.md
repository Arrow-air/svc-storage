## :telescope: Overview

svc-storage is responsible for storing and retrieving data from the Arrow database and other storage.
It's meant to be used only by other internal services via GRPC interface.
- server - [bin] target to run gRPC server
- client - [lib] target for other services to import and use

Directory:
- `server/src/`: Source Code and Unit Tests of the server
- `client-grpc/src/`: Autogenerated gRPC Client Source Code and examples
- `proto/`: Types used for gRPC messaging
- `tests/`: Integration Tests
- `docs/`: Module Documentation

## Make

### Build and Test

To ensure consistent build and test outputs, Arrow provides a Docker image with all required software installed to build and test Rust projects.
Using the Makefile, you can easily test and build your code.

```bash
# Build Locally
make rust-build

# Create Deployment Container
make build

# Run Deployment Container
make docker-run

# Stopping Deployment Container
make docker-stop

# Running examples (uses docker compose file)
make rust-example-grpc
```

### Formatting

The Arrow docker image has some formatting tools installed which can fix your code formatting for you.
Using the Makefile, you can easily run the formatters on your code.
Make sure to commit your code before running these commands, as they might not always result in a desired outcome.

```bash
# Format TOML files
make toml-tidy

# Format Rust files
make rust-tidy

# Format Python files
make python-tidy

# Format all at once
make tidy
```

### Other `make` Targets

There are additional make targets available. You can find all possible targets by running make without a target or use `make help`

## :exclamation: Treatment of `Cargo.lock`
If you are building a non-end product like a library, include `Cargo.lock` in `.gitignore`.

If you are building an end product like a command line tool, check `Cargo.lock` to the git.

Read more about it [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/cargo-toml-vs-cargo-lock.html);

## Cockroachdb
The database connection requires TLS.
When running cockroachdb for development, certificates will automatically be generated and used by the server.

### Cockroachdb key generation
Certificates are automatically generated by the `cockroachdb-init` container in case they're missing.
They are written to a dedicated `cockroachdb-ssl` volume so they can be shared with the services that need them.
Note that these are all snake-oil and should not be used for production.

## Example
Run the example:
```
make rust-example-grpc
```

## MacOS troubleshooting

1. Currently, the `make build` command does not work on MacOS with M1 processor so running the example will fail.
As a workaround we can start only the cockroachdb with `docker-compose up cockroachdb` and then `cargo run` to start the svc-storage server.

2. The other problem on MacOS is that it doesn't trust automatically generated cockroachdb certificates. (Errors like "certificate not trusted" or "bad certificate")
As a workaround we need to add/change these env variables in .env file
```
PG__HOST=localhost
PG__SSLMODE=disable
USE_TLS=false
```
and then modify the `docker-compose.yml` file and replace line
`command: start-single-node --certs-dir=/cockroach/ssl/certs --advertise-addr=cockroachdb`
with:
`command: start-single-node --insecure --advertise-addr=cockroachdb`

This will run the cockroachdb and svc-storage without TLS using username/password.
